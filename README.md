## Introduction

SoundFlow is a robust and versatile .NET audio engine designed for seamless cross-platform audio processing. It provides a comprehensive set of features for audio playback, recording, processing, analysis, and visualization, all within a well-structured and extensible framework.

**Key Features:**

*   **Cross-Platform by Design:**  Runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS or any other .NET compatible platform.
*   **Modular Component Architecture:** Build custom audio pipelines by connecting sources, modifiers, mixers, and analyzers.
*   **Extensibility:** Easily add custom audio components, effects, and visualizers to tailor the engine to your specific needs.
*   **High Performance:** Optimized for real-time audio processing with SIMD support and efficient memory management.
*   **Playback:** Play audio from various sources, including files, streams, and in-memory assets.
*   **Recording:** Capture audio input and save it to different encoding formats.
*   **Mixing:** Combine multiple audio streams with precise control over volume and panning.
*   **Effects:** Apply a wide range of audio effects, including reverb, chorus, delay, equalization, and more.
*   **Analysis:** Extract valuable information from audio data, such as RMS level, peak level, frequency spectrum, and voice activity.
*   **Visualization:** Create engaging visual representations of audio waveforms, spectrums, and level meters.
*   **Surround Sound:** Supports advanced surround sound configurations with customizable speaker positions, delays, and panning methods.
*   **HLS Streaming Support:**  Integrate internet radio and online audio via HTTP Live Streaming.
*   **Backend Agnostic:** Supports the `MiniAudio` backend out of the box, with the ability to add others.

## Getting Started

### Installation

**NuGet Package Manager:**

```
Install-Package SoundFlow
```

**.NET CLI:**

```
dotnet add package SoundFlow
```

### Basic Usage Example

This example demonstrates how to play an audio file using SoundFlow:

```csharp
using SoundFlow.Abstracts;
using SoundFlow.Backends.MiniAudio;
using SoundFlow.Components;
using SoundFlow.Providers;
using SoundFlow.Enums;

// Initialize the audio engine with the MiniAudio backend
using var audioEngine = new MiniAudioEngine(44100, Capability.Playback);

// Create a SoundPlayer and load an audio file
var player = new SoundPlayer(new StreamDataProvider(File.OpenRead("path/to/your/audiofile.wav")));

// Add the player to the master mixer
Mixer.Master.AddComponent(player);

// Start playback
player.Play();

// Keep the console application running until playback finishes
Console.WriteLine("Playing audio... Press any key to stop.");
Console.ReadKey();

// Stop playback and remove the player from the mixer
player.Stop();
Mixer.Master.RemoveComponent(player);
```

## Core Concepts

SoundFlow is built upon a few key concepts:

*   **Audio Engine (`AudioEngine`):** The central component that manages audio device initialization, data processing, and the audio graph.
*   **Sound Components (`SoundComponent`):** Modular units that process or generate audio, forming a directed graph through input and output connections.
*   **Mixer (`Mixer`):** Combines multiple audio streams into a single output.
*   **Sound Modifiers (`SoundModifier`):** Apply audio effects like reverb, chorus, delay, and equalization.
*   **Audio Playback & Recording:** Components for playing and capturing audio, including surround sound support.
*   **Audio Providers:** Standardized way to read audio data from various sources (files, streams, memory).
*   **Audio Analysis & Visualization:** Tools for extracting information from audio and creating visual representations.

**For detailed information on these concepts, please refer to the [SoundFlow Documentation](https://lsxprime.github.io/soundflow-docs/).**

## API Reference

Comprehensive API documentation will be available on the **[SoundFlow Documentation](https://lsxprime.github.io/soundflow-docs/)**.

## Tutorials and Examples

The **[Documentation](https://lsxprime.github.io/soundflow-docs/)** provides a wide range of tutorials and examples to help you get started:

*   **Playback:** Playing audio files and streams, controlling playback.
*   **Recording:** Recording audio, using voice activity detection.
*   **Effects:** Applying various audio effects.
*   **Analysis:** Getting RMS level, analyzing frequency spectrum.
*   **Visualization:** Creating level meters, waveform displays, and spectrum analyzers.
